# dotfiles
My dotfiles from my home desktop running gNewSense GNU/Linux, based on Debian.

Created using the technique described here: https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/ which definitely has at least one [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170326125752/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/) on the Wayback Machine.

The only change I made to that technique was the addition of this readme. I wanted to be able to come back to that article explaining the somewhat non-trivial order of steps in restoring these dotfiles, so I wanted to add a readme. However, I don't want a big ol' `README.md` in my home directory. So, I added this, committed, and then removed it. Then I added it to .gitignore.
